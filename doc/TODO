* alias_method and alias_method_chain
* make global function "extend"
* make Object#extended_* methods static so that extending classes only happens once instead of on instantiation
* look into __callStatic for extending static methods
* look into using ReflectionMethod#invoke (might be able to call protected/private methods that way)
* Add real tests
